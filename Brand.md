<aside>
👉🏻

Based on the insights from our Brand Q&A, we have refined the core strategic elements of the brand.

</aside>

## 1. ACTIVITY: WHAT IF?

![image.png](attachment:6634c55f-4f54-4c9c-af4b-e20154a43fa8:image.png)

This exercise defines the brand's personality and "approachable aesthetic."

- **FURNITURE:** A beautifully crafted, comfortable Mid-century modern armchair. It is dependable, has "approachable aesthetics," and is "quietly radiant"—representing both function and form.
- **MUSICIAN:** Joni Mitchell or Florence + The Machine (unplugged). Their music is "passionate," intelligent, and has a touch of the "fairy-godmother" magic and emotional depth.
- **MOVIE/TV SHOW:** The film *Amélie*. It is a story built on "aesthetics" and "joy," about one person magically transforming a "community" for the better, one small, caring act at a time.
- **BAG:** A locally designed, high-quality canvas tote with leather handles. It is practical, beautiful, and "quietly radiant," signaling support for the local community and good taste.
- **CUISINE:** "Farm-to-table." This perfectly captures the "aesthetics x wellness x community" wave you are riding. It is honest, high-quality, and rooted in the local environment.

## 2. ACTIVITY: BRAND ARCHETYPES

![image.png](attachment:cb01c779-c8c6-4352-b86b-33c2e710703e:image.png)

Your customer insights reveal a powerful combination.

1. **THE CARETAKER:** This is the brand's heart.
    - **Evidence:** "Empowering people," "removes...anxiety," "your friendly, reliable houseplant mentor," "warm, dependable."
    - **Role:** You protect and nurture your customers, ensuring their success and removing their fears.
2. **THE MAGICIAN:** This is the brand's hand.
    - **Evidence:** "Plant fairy-godmother," "Godsend."
    - **Role:** A "Sage" (which we first thought) simply *gives information*. A "Magician" creates *transformation*. You transform customer "anxiety" into "joy" and "confidence." You transform a complex, failing hobby into a simple, successful one. This is a more potent and accurate "Big Idea."

**OUR ARCHETYPE:** **The Nurturing Magician**

## 3. ACTIVITY: BRAND DNA

## 5. ACTIVITY: BRAND MISSION

![image.png](attachment:b157d25d-b8c6-4cf8-a86d-2475a5b37d4a:image.png)

We will adopt the precise, powerful language from your Q&A.

- **MY BRAND EXISTS TO:** Attract and serve the Savannah community through approachable aesthetics and practical education.
- **BECAUSE THE WORLD NEEDS:** A lifestyle that unites aesthetics, wellness, and community, and a "godsend" to remove the anxiety from plant care.
- **IN ORDER TO:** Empower people to share the joy of houseplant care by building confident, stable skills.

## 6. ACTIVITY: IKIGAI (PURPOSE)

![image.png](attachment:d63924fd-b0a8-41ce-b492-a4523b7ab317:image.png)

This is the central story we will tell.

## 7. ACTIVITY: BRAND ESSENCE GRID

![image.png](attachment:c213e0fa-85a7-4a04-8c24-f2113b80142e:image.png)

This is the final, distilled truth. This is the promise our advertising must make.
